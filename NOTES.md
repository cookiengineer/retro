## Build Process

### WebCore

WebCore builds each `HTML...Element.cpp` interface automatically, based on available
attributes and names.

- Element Names are defined in [HTMLTagNames.in](/Source/WebCore/html/HTMLTagNames.in).
- Element Attributes are defined in [HTMLAttributeNames.in](/Source/WebCore/html/HTMLAttributeNames.in).
- Macros for Code Generation are defined in [WebCoreMacros.cmake](/Source/WebCore/WebCoreMacros.cmake).


The code for the ECMAScript Bindings are generated by the [CodeGeneratorJS.pm](/Source/WebCore/bindings/scripts/CodeGeneratorJS.pm),
and additionally are also based on the equivalent `idl` files for each exposed Interface.

For example, the `/Source/WebCore/dom/Document...idl` files are combined together into
the `/WebCore/DerivedSources/JSDocument...{.cpp,.h}` files, whose filenames are generated
by their permutations of possible combinations.
